# Hostel Management System for IIT Bhilai

## Introduction

The Hostel Management System for IIT Bhilai is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management of hostel operations. Our team identified several challenges faced by students and administration in managing hostel facilities effectively. This project aims to address those issues and provide a user-friendly platform for both students and hostel management staff.

## Problem Statement

While managing hostel facilities at IIT Bhilai, we encountered several challenges, including:

- **Inefficient Room Allocation**: Difficulty in assigning rooms to students based on their preferences and requirements.
- **Communication Gaps**: Lack of a centralized platform for announcements and communication between students and hostel administration.
- **Maintenance Requests**: Complicated processes for reporting and tracking maintenance issues.
- **Dining Management**: Challenges in managing dining services, including meal preferences and feedback.
- **Visitor Management**: Difficulty in tracking visitor entries and exits, leading to security concerns.

## Solution Overview

To tackle these issues, we developed a Hostel Management System that offers the following features:

- **Room Allocation**: An automated system for efficient room assignment based on student preferences.
- **Centralized Communication**: A platform for announcements, notifications, and direct communication between students and administration.
- **Maintenance Management**: Easy reporting and tracking of maintenance requests to ensure timely resolutions.
- **Dining Management**: Tools for managing meal preferences, feedback, and dining schedules.
- **Visitor Management**: A secure system for tracking visitor entries and exits to enhance safety.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the **MERN stack**, which includes:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js to build APIs.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
